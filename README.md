# About
This is a simple antirootkit system created for a university course.
It was created and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with kernel 5.13.0 (x86_64).

# Install
## Be careful!
This module is not stable so **use a virtual machine**
to avoid any potential kernel panics or other nasty stuff.
## Linux headers
Install linux kernel headers.
### apt
`sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
### pacman
`sudo pacman -S linux-headers`
### yum
`sudo yum install kernel-devel`

## Build and load
In order to build 
1. Enter the `BSO_antirootkit_LKM` directory.
2. (Optional) Choose checks to be run by editing `include/config.h`.
3. Build with `make`.
4. Load the module with `make load`.
5. Unload the module with `make unload`.
6. Check output with `dmesg`.

# Kernel integrity checks
## Syscall hooks
`sys_call_table` is a kernel structure that stores addresses of syscalls.
Rootkits may try to overwrite the table's entries with malicious ones.
### kallsyms_lookup_name
First, we need to find the `sys_call_table` address.
To do so, we might use `kallsyms_lookup_name` function which takes a symbol's name
and returns its address. 
In newer kernel versions (> 5.7.0) this function is no longer exported. 
Thus, we need to use the following workaround that uses kernel probes 
```c
typedef unsigned long (*kallsyms_lookup_name_t)(const char *name);

void setup_sys_call_check(void) {
//    Create kernel probe and set kp.symbol_name to the desired function
    struct kprobe kp = {
            .symbol_name = "kallsyms_lookup_name"
    };
//    Create a function pointer that will later store the desired address
    kallsyms_lookup_name_t kallsyms_lookup_name;
//    Register kprobe, so it searches for the symbol given by kp.symbol_name
    register_kprobe(&kp);
//    Retrieve address
    kallsyms_lookup_name = (kallsyms_lookup_name_t) kp.addr;
//    Now we can unregister kprobe and return the pointer to sys_call_table
    unregister_kprobe(&kp);
    sys_call_table = (unsigned long *) kallsyms_lookup_name("sys_call_table");
}
```
### Disabling memory write protection
Now we have the `sys_call_table` address, but we still can't overwrite its entries,
because it's located in read-only memory. The Intel manual reads: 
> Write Protect (bit 16 of CR0) â€” When set, inhibits supervisor-level procedures from writing into read-
> only pages; when clear, allows supervisor-level procedures to write into read-only pages (...).

We need to clear the `WP` bit of `cr0` register. In modern kernels 
using the function `native_write_cr0` gives a permission error.
The kernel doesn't allow you to remove write protection.
Of course, we can bypass it by forcefully writing to `cr0` with
```c
inline void force_write_cr0(unsigned long val) {
    asm volatile(
    "mov %0, %%cr0"
    : "+r"(val)
    );
}
```
so that we can disable WP with
```c
#define WP_BIT 0x10000

void disable_memory_protection(void) {
    force_write_cr0(read_cr0() & (~WP_BIT));
}
```
### Hooking syscalls
Now we just create our own function and overwrite `sys_call_table` with it.
We also want to store somewhere the original function pointers, so we can call them from within
our evil hook.

### Detection
#### Comparison
This module creates a copy of `sys_call_table` on init. If our module was loaded before the rootkit,
we can compare addresses from the table currently present in memory with the saved ones. 
If addresses don't match, there is a hook. Then we can warn the user and restore the original address.

#### core_kernel_text
However, even if a rootkit was loaded first, we can still try to detect hooks.
We iterate over every `sys_call_table` entry
and call `core_kernel_text` which takes an address and tells us whether it belongs to the 
core kernel text memory section.
Similarily to `kallsyms_lookup_name`, this function isn't available by traditional means,
so we also have to do some address lookup.
Whenever `core_kernel_text` returns 0, we warn the user and try to recover the address.

#### Recovering original syscalls
We can, once again using `kallsyms_lookup_name`, search for original syscalls. For every `sys_call_table`
entry that isn't originated in the core kernel text area, we take its name and call `kallsyms_lookup_name`.
We retrieve the address and write it to `sys_call_table`.


## Ftrace hooks
### How it works
The aforementioned approach isn't able to detect all types of hooks. One may also hook 
syscalls (or, in general, important functions) using ftrace. To understand how ftrace hooks
functions, we can look at the first couple of bytes of a function. We can use this
fragment of code
```c
static void get_func_assembly(char *ptr){
    char bytes[201];
    int i;

    memzero_explicit(bytes, 201);

    for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
        sprintf(bytes, "%s%02hhX", bytes, ptr[i]);
    }
    printk("%s\n", bytes);
}
```

After we call it on the address of `__x64_sys_kill`, we get 
```
0F1F4400005531D2BE010000004889E54155415453654C8B2425C0FB01004883
EC38488B5F684C8B6F704C89E765488B042528000000488945E031C048C745B8
0000000048C745C00000000048C745C80000000048C745D00000000048C745D8
00000000
```
Now we can use a tool like https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm to disassemble it
```
0:  0f 1f 44 00 00          nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
5:  55                      push   rbp
6:  31 d2                   xor    edx,edx
8:  be 01 00 00 00          mov    esi,0x1
d:  48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
10: 41 55                   push   r13
12: 41 54                   push   r12
14: 53                      push   rbx
/* ... */
```
The first 5 bytes is just a nop.
We can do the same thing, but after the `__x64_sys_kill` function is hooked with ftrace
```
0:  e8 1b 02 0a 2a          call   0x2a0a0220
5:  55                      push   rbp
6:  31 d2                   xor    edx,edx
8:  be 01 00 00 00          mov    esi,0x1
d:  48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp
10: 41 55                   push   r13
12: 41 54                   push   r12
14: 53                      push   rbx
/* ... */
```

The first 5-byte nop instruction was replaced by a call to an ftrace callback.
This is the reason those 5 bytes are there. If ftrace wants to hook a function, it replaces them
with its own `call` instruction.

#### Note on avoiding recursion
Notice that at some point we want to call the original function
(otherwise we will most likely break something or even more likely a lot of things). 
However, if we call the original function
from within the wrapper, the ftrace hook will trigger again, we will go to the wrapper, which will
call the original and so on... To avoid this, we can simply shift the original function pointer by
5 bytes (we basically jump over the ftrace call and get to the actual function code). You can read more
about hooking with ftrace (and how the code used here works) 
on https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/546-hooking-linux-functions-2.

### Detecting ftrace hooks
Detection here is pretty straightforward. We define a set of funtions that we want to monitor, and 
we check if 5 intial bytes of those functions are the `nop` intruction.
If they are not, we replace them with `nop`, effectively removing a hook.
A problem arises when we use some legit software that traces functions for whatever reason.
